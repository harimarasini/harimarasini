Hello, Its me @harimarasini
Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Poultry Science Department at University of Georgia
I'm interested in exploring the gut microbiome and its effect in poultry behavior through immune pathways
I'm looking forward to collaborating with the poultry industry research  professionals interested in improving poultry health and welfare.
