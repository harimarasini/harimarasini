Hello, this is @harimarasini.
Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Poultry Science Department at the University of Georgia.
I'm interested in exploring the gut microbiome and its effect on poultry behavior through immune pathways.
I'm looking forward to collaborating with the research professionals around academia and industry personnel with a focus on  improving poultry health and welfare.
